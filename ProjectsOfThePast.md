# Past Project Ideas

These are some project ideas from past semesters.
These should serve as starting points for your own ideas.

### Service apps
- an app to manage group communication
  - create events, manage attendees
  - manage membership
  - in-group communications (direct and forum)
  - intended for fraternity/sorority type groups
- a text scheduler app
  - send at a specific time or location (geofence)
- a privacy lock app
  - locks your phone to certain apps
  - privacy while allowing others to use your phone
  - e.g. make a phone call, but require separate passcode to access anything else
- a voice recording app
  - lets user tag sessions
  - lets user bookmark certain parts of recording for easy access
  - intended for students, researchers, interviewers
- a music markup app
  - lets you create, edit, and play songs in-app
  - intended for beginner guitar players
- multiple apps related to food
  - inventory management
  - search recipes
  - suggest wine pairings
  - and more


### Game apps
- recreate existing board game as an app
  - existing rules - you don't have to invent them
  - note: cannot put on play store if copyright exists
- invent new game
  - your game, your rules. you are king
  - no copyrights! you can put this on the play store
* puzzles
* board games
* fighting games
* etc.

Avoid simple word games. They have relatively little logic and don't have much substance.


### Joke apps!
**Don't do these.** The first one was proposed to a friend of mine by a business major.
When someone says _"hey, you write code right? so I have this idea for an app..."_, run the other way.
- battery power sharing app
  - if your battery runs low, you can post a request for more
  - other app users with plenty of battery can send you some of theirs
  - _are you kidding me?_
- wifi saver
  - store internet in a battery while you're on wifi
  - when you have no wifi, just plug in the battery!
  - _what were you thinking?_
  
**Don't do these.**
